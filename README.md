The script was developed as part of a project carried out during the "Industrial Power Engineering" course.

The project's theme was "Utilizing electrical energy storage systems to enhance the economic efficiency of an industrial facility."

The input data consisted of the electricity consumption profile based on the season (summer/winter) and the type of day (workday/holiday).

The first step of the project involved extending the energy consumption profile for the entire year 2023. Subsequently, with knowledge of the precise energy consumption over the year, the next task was to select a tariff group offered by the electricity supplier, Enea. The available options included tariff groups B21, B22, or B23. [1]

Once the tariff group was chosen, it was possible to proceed with simulating the energy storage system. The assumption was that energy storage systems would be charged during off-peak hours and discharged during peak hours determined by the characteristics of the selected tariff group. This approach ensured that energy would only need to be purchased for the energy storage system's own needs during peak hours.
